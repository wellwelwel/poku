# Philosophy

**Poku**'s philosophy focuses on simplicity and efficiency, removing complexities to make testing accessible from the simplest to the most complex projects.

## JavaScript Essence for Tests ðŸ’¡

Imagine you want to execute asynchronous functions, where one runs after the other, and display a message at the beginning and end of the execution:

```ts
console.log('Started');

await funcA();
await funcB();

console.log('Done');
```

Normally, we can't do this with most test runners.
See this fictional example:

```ts
describe('My Test', { concurrency: 1 }, () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    console.log('Started');
  });

  // The last step of the script is called before the tests themselves
  afterAll(() => {
    console.log('Done');
  });

  it(async () => {
    // async test
  });

  it(async () => {
    // async test
  });
});
```

Also, you can't run this like `node test.js` due to evaluations, global state, or test transformations, where you need to run your test using the test runner.

**Poku** brings back the **JavaScript** essence to tests:

```ts
import { describe, it } from 'poku';

describe('My Test', () => {
  console.log('Started');

  await it(async () => {
    // async test
  });

  await it(async () => {
    // async test
  });

  console.log('Done');
});
```

:::tip

**Poku** doesn't use a global state, allowing you to use it how and where you want:

```sh
# Node.js + Poku
npx poku test.js

# Node.js
node test.js

# Bun + Poku
bunx poku test.js

# Bun
bun test.js

# Deno + Poku
deno run npm:poku test.js

# Deno
deno run test.js

# Yarn + Poku
yarn poku test.js

# pnpm + Poku
pnpm poku test.js
```

- Same idea for **TypeScript**.

## Making Tests Really Easy ðŸŒ±

In many cases, tests lead to the same common objective: the assertion of an expected value with a dynamic value.

But tests usually don't show enough logs and details if you only focus on assertions. Even if they work, you might easily encounter an error message like "at least one test is necessary":

```ts
import assert from 'node:assert';

const one = 1;
assert.equal(one, 1, '1 needs to be equal to 1');
```

- The assert message in this example will only be displayed if the assertion test is invalid, and the test will pass silently.

Instead of:

```ts
import assert from 'node:assert';
import test from 'node:test';

test('one is equal to 1', () => {
  const one = 1;
  assert.equal(one, 1, '1 needs to be equal to 1');
});
```

**Poku** allows a test following the **BDD**/**TDD** method using only the assert method:

```ts
import { assert } from 'poku';

const one = 1;
assert.equal(one, 1, 'one is equal to 1');
```

:::tip

- This will generate a complete log, both in case of success or failure, maintaining the exact **Node.js** development style, but being compatible with **Node.js**, **Bun**, and **Deno** without any need for alteration or configuration.
- Each case can be different. For this, **Poku** has a completely modular way of using it, allowing you to use `test`, `describe`, `it`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach` and etc. according to your needs for more complex tests or tests that follow a specified pattern.

## Why Not Install External Dependencies? ðŸ“¦

To keep the final installation size as lightweight as possible and to avoid compatibility issues with legacy environments.
Also by requiring all possible dependencies to be fully compatible with **Node.js**, **Bun** and **Deno**.
