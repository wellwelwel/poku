# Philosophy

**Poku**'s philosophy focuses on simplicity and efficiency, removing complexities to make testing accessible from the simplest to the most complex projects.

**Poku** eliminates the need for new learning, as it adopts assert with the same usability as Node.js and retains most of the popular features for test runners, while being naturally compatible with [**Node.js**][node-version-url], [**Bun**][bun-version-url] and [**Deno**][deno-version-url], including older versions, and it's truly **zero configuration**.

Moreover, **Poku** does away with the headache of dealing with different environments like **CJS** or **ESM**, as it adapts to any setting (even [**TypeScript**][typescript-url] without compilation when paired with [**tsx**][tsx]).

Also, **Poku** doesn't use a global state, allowing you to use it how and where you want.

Is it a cloud? No, it's **Poku**! It's not just lightweight; it doesn't even have external dependencies, allowing you to only add advanced features when really necessary.
