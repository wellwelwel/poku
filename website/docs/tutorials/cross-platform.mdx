<hr />

## Running tests in specific platforms

```sh
npx poku
```

- It runs **Poku** through **Node.js** and ensures that all tests are run with **Node.js** (or **tsx** for **TypeScript** tests).

```sh
bun poku
```

- It runs **Poku** through **Bun** and ensures that all tests are run with **Bun**.

```sh
deno run npm:poku
```

- It runs **Poku** through **Deno** and ensures that all tests are run with **Deno**.

:::tip
For **TypeScript** users, there's no need to install **tsx** for **Bun** and **Deno**, as they both run **TypeScript** natively.

<hr />

### Running CommonJS with Deno `v1`

> See all options for **Deno** [here](/docs/documentation/poku/options/deno).

#### All files as CommonJS

```sh
deno run npm:poku --denoCjs
```

#### A specific extension as CommonJS

```sh
deno run npm:poku --denoCjs='.cjs'
```

#### Multiple extensions as CommonJS

```sh
deno run npm:poku --denoCjs='.cjs,.js'
```

<hr />

:::tip
It's usually beneficial to have an exclusive _CI_ for each platform, especially to ensure better control in error cases.
