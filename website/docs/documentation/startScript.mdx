# Start Script

Run your `package.json` scripts in a background process and test them 🧑🏻‍🔬

> startScript(filePath: string, options?: startScriptOptions);
>
> _Since **1.9.0**_

`startScript` execute a script directly from your `package.json` or `deno.json` and keep it running in a background process until you release it.

      Really useful to test your
      [**NextJS**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js),
      [**NuxtJS**](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt),
      [**nodemon**](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) and every project app 🚀

      **Poku** allows you to use the requester you want, such as
      [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios), the native `fetch` and
      everyone ✨

  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      No need to add external plugins to something so simple, just run it as it
      is 🌱
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      Stop changing your code due to tester rules, you created your code, not
      **Poku** 🩵

## Good Practices 👮🏽

### ✅ Sinalize the "ready" status

When possible, set a console output to indicate that the service is ready. <br />
This will allow you to avoid premature executions and port leaks.

### ✅ Set a timeout

By defining a timeout, you avert indefinite processes that conclude neither in success nor failure.

### ✅ End your service when the job is done

You don't necessarily have to end your service running in the background as the last line of the test, if it's no longer used.

```ts
import { startScript } from 'poku'; // 'npm:poku' for Deno

const server = await startScript('start', {
  /**
   * Wait for the "ready" console output
   */
  startAfter: 'Ready',

  /**
   * By default, the `timeout` is `60000` (1 minute) for neither in success nor failure
   */
  timeout: 60000,
});

server.end();
```

<FAQ title='Oh No! I broke it, and now? 🤡'>

Releasing a leaking port:

```bash
lsof -i :PORT
```

- Replace `PORT` with the port number you're investigating.

Then, use the `PID` returned with the `kill` command:

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

- Replace `PID` with the actual process ID you found using the `lsof` command.

## Available Options

```ts
type StartScriptOptions = {
  /**
   * - By default, it will resolve in the first console output
   * - By setting a string: it will wait for a specifc string on console output to resolve
   * - By setting a number: it will wait for time in milliseconds to resolve
   *
   * @default undefined
   */
  startAfter?: string | number;
  /**
   * Stops the service after:
   * @default 60000
   */
  timeout?: number;
  /**
   * Shows the output from service
   */
  verbose?: boolean;
  /**
   * Specify a target path to start the process
   *
   * @default "./"
   */
  cwd?: string | undefined;
  /**
   * By default, Poku will use `npm`. Change it as you want.
   */
  runner?: 'npm' | 'bun' | 'deno' | 'yarn' | 'pnpm';
};
```
