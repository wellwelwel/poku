# Start Script

Run your `package.json` scripts in a background process and test them 🧑🏻‍🔬

> startScript(filePath: string, options?: startScriptOptions);
>
> _Since **1.9.0**_

`startScript` execute a script directly from your `package.json` or `deno.json` and keep it running in a background process until you release it.

<div className='features black'>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      Really useful to test your
      [**NextJS**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js),
      [**NuxtJS**](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt),
      [**nodemon**](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) and every project app 🚀

    <span>Allows **cookies** to persist (_or not_) 🍪</span>

  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      **Poku** allows you to use the requester you want, such as
      [**Axios**](https://github.com/axios/axios), the native `fetch` and
      everyone ✨
    </span>

  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      No need to add external plugins to something so simple, just run it as it
      is 🌱
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      Stop changing your code due to tester rules, you created your code, not
      **Poku** 🩵

## Good Practices 👮🏽

### ✅ Sinalize the "ready" status

When possible, set a console output to indicate that the service is ready. <br />
This will allow you to avoid premature executions and port leaks.

### ✅ Set a timeout

By defining a timeout, you avert indefinite processes that conclude neither in success nor failure.

### ✅ End your service when the job is done

You don't necessarily have to end your service running in the background as the last line of the test, if it's no longer used.

```ts
import { startScript } from 'poku';

const server = await startScript('start', {
  /**
   * Wait for the "ready" console output
   */
  startAfter: 'ready',

  /**
   * By default, the `timeout` is `60000` (1 minute) for neither success nor failure
   */
  timeout: 60000,
});

await server.end();
```

:::tip

You can pass a port to `end` to enforce the background subprocess end for **Bun** and **Deno**.

ℹ️ To use a port in `end`, you will need `lsof` for **Unix** or `netstat` for **Windows**.

:::

:::info
If you're encountering issues using this feature with **Bun**, please see [**oven-sh/bun#11055**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/11055) when using `end` method passing a port or [**oven-sh/bun#7441**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/7441) for unfinished subprocesses.

<FAQ title='Oh No! I broke it, and now? 🤡'>

Releasing a leaking port:

```bash
lsof -i :PORT
```

- Replace `PORT` with the port number you're investigating.

Then, use the `PID` returned with the `kill` command:

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

- Replace `PID` with the actual process ID you found using the `lsof` command.

```ts

   * - By default, it will resolve in the first console output
   * - By setting a string: it will wait for a specifc string on console output to resolve
   * - By setting a number: it will wait for time in milliseconds to resolve
   *

   * ℹ️ `startAfter` is case sensitive.

  startAfter?: string | number;
  /**

  timeout?: number;
  /**

type End = (port?: number | number[]) => Promise<void>;
