# test

> `test(() => void)`

`test` is a helper to assist you in such cases:

- Use the beforeEach and afterEach for each `test` performed
- Isolate or group your tests in the same file

```ts
import { test, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'poku';

const prepareService = () => true;
const resetService = () => true;

beforeEach(() => prepareService(), {
  assert: false,
});

afterEach(() => resetService(), {
  assert: false,
});

test(() => {
  // do anything you want
});

test(() => {
  // do anything you want
});
```

:::info
Ensure you disabled the assert on **beforeEach** and **afterEach**.
:::

## By using promises

```ts
import { test, beforeEach, afterEach } from 'poku';

const prepareService = () =>
  new Promise((resolve) => resolve(true), {
    assert: false,
  });

const resetService = () =>
  new Promise((resolve) => resolve(true), {
    assert: false,
  });

beforeEach(async () => await prepareService());
afterEach(async () => await resetService());

await test(async () => {
  // do anything you want
});

await test(async () => {
  // do anything you want
});
```
