# log

Since by default **Poku** only shows outputs generated from itself, this helper allows you to use an alternative to `console.log` with **Poku** runner.

```ts
import { log } from 'poku';

log('Poku will show it');

console.log("Poku won't show that");
```

:::tip
Need to debug? Just use the [`debug`](/docs/documentation/poku/options/debug) option from `poku`.
