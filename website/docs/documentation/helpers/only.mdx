# 🌌 only

`.only` is an extended helper for `describe`, `it`, and `test` to assist you debug tests.

## Usage

You need to pass one of the temporary flags below to use the `.only` helper:

> Look for "👋🏻" in the following examples.

### `--only`

- Only tests using `.only` will be run. This applies to `describe`, `it` and `test` at the same time.
- If a common `describe` has a `it.only` in its scope, for example, the `it.only` will not be reached (see [**`--itOnly`**](#--itonly)).

```ts
import { describe, it, test, assert } from 'poku';

describe("I won't be executed", () => {
  it("I won't be reached", async () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });
});

describe.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
  it("I won't be executed", () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });

  it.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
    assert(true);
  });

  test.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
    assert(true);
  });
});

describe("I won't be executed", () => {
  it.only("I won't be reached, as `describe` is never executed", () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });
});

test.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
  assert(true);
});
```

```bash
npx poku --only

# Same as:
npx poku --describeOnly --itOnly
```

:::note
By using `.only` without `--only`, `--describeOnly`, `--itOnly` or `--testOnly` flag, the test in question will force failure.
:::

### `--itOnly`

> Alias: `--testOnly`

- Only `it` and `test` tests using `.only` will be run. This doens't apply to `describe`.

```ts
import { test, describe, it, assert } from 'poku';

test("I won't be executed", () => {
  process.exit(1);
});

test.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
  assert(true);
});

describe("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
  it("I won't be executed", () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });

  it.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
    assert(true);
  });
});
```

```bash
npx poku --itOnly
```

:::note
By using `.only` in `describe` with `--itOnly` or `--testOnly` flag, the test in question will force failure.
:::

### `--describeOnly`

- Only `describe` tests using `.only` will be run. This doens't apply to `it` and `test`.

```ts
import { test, describe, it, assert } from 'poku';

describe("I won't be executed", () => {
  it("I won't be reached", async () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });
});

describe.only("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
  it("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
    assert(true);
  });

  test("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
    assert(true);
  });
});

describe("I won't be executed", () => {
  it.only("I won't be reached, as `describe` is never executed", () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });
});

test("I'll be executed 👋🏻", () => {
  assert(true);
});
```

:::note
By using `.only` in `it` or `test` with `--describeOnly` flag, the test in question will force failure.
