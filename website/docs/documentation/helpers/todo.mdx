# ðŸ“‹ todo

`.todo` is an extended helper for `describe`, `it`, and `test` to assist you plan future tests.

## Basic Usage

### Simple message

```ts
import { describe, it, test } from 'poku';

describe.todo('todo: Upcoming test');

it.todo('todo: Upcoming test');

test.todo('todo: Upcoming test');
```

- There is no difference between the features.

Also in internal contexts:

```ts
import { describe, it } from 'poku';

describe(() => {
  it.todo('todo: Upcoming test');

  it('Real test', () => {
    /* ... */
  });
});
```

### Ignoring a callback

This can be useful when you already have an idea or prototype of what you want to test, but you don't want the test to actually run.<br />
It can also be useful for tests that have unexpectedly stopped working due to some external event, requiring further attention.

```ts
import { describe, it } from 'poku';

describe.todo('todo: Upcoming test', () => {
  it(async () => {
    process.exit(1);
  });
});
```

- The method received by `todo` and everything inside it will be completely ignored.

<hr />

:::note
When using `beforeEach` or `afterEach`, they will not be triggered by tests with `.todo`.
