# ⏭️ skip

You can skip tests when necessary, for example, tests that don't match a specific platform version or

```ts
import { skip } from 'poku';

skip();
```

You can also pass a optional message to `skip` method:

```ts
import { skip } from 'poku';

skip('Skipping for some reason');
```

:::important
This will skip the entire file and it's recommended to be used at the top of the test file.
:::

## Examples

Imagine that a specific test doesn't work on a specific _OS_:

```ts
import { test, skip } from 'poku';
// highlight-start
import { platform } from 'node:process';

const isWindows = platform === 'win32';

// highlight-end
if (isWindows) skip('Skipping due to incompatibility with Windows');

// Runs tests normally on other operating systems
// highlight-start
test(() => {
  // ...
});
// highlight-end
```

:::note
Skipped tests are considered successful tests.
