# `watch`

Watches the events on tests and files that contains tests (after running all the tests), re-running the tests files that are updated for each new event.

<History
  records={[
    {
      version: '2.2.0',
      changes: [
        <>
          Support for <code>-w</code> short flag.
        </>,
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

## CLI

```bash
npx poku --watch
```

You can use the flag `--watchInterval` to set a custom interval for `watch` events in milliseconds:

> Default is `1500`

```bash
npx poku --watch --watchInterval=1500
```

- Short flag: `-w`.
