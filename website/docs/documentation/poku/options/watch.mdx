# `watch`

Watches the events on test paths (after running all the tests), re-running the tests files that are updated for each new event.

> Currently, `watch` mode only watches for events from test files and directories.

## CLI

```bash
npx poku --watch
```

You can use the flag `--watch-interval` to set a custom interval for `watch` events in milliseconds:

> Default is `1500`

```bash
npx poku --watch --watch-interval=1500
```
