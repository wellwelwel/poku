# `watch`

Watches the events on tests and files that contains tests (after running all the tests), re-running the tests files that are updated for each new event.

## CLI

```bash
npx poku --watch
```

You can use the flag `--watch-interval` to set a custom interval for `watch` events in milliseconds:

> Default is `1500`

```bash
npx poku --watch --watch-interval=1500
```

:::note

Currently, the deep dependency search doesn't consider line-breaking imports, for example:

```ts
import {
  moduleA,
  moduleB,
  moduleC,
  moduleD,
  moduleE,
  moduleF,
} from './some.js';
```
