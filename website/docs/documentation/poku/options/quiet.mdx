# `quiet`

Perform tests with no logs. <br />
This option overwrites all `log` settings by exiting with code and no logs (see bellow).

## CLI

```bash
npx poku --quiet ./test
```

## API

```ts
await poku('./test', {
  quiet: true,
});
```

<hr />

:::note
Since **Poku** doesn't transform files, tests using `beforeEach` or `afterEach` with external consoles can be generated.
