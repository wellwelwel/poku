# Start Service

Run your services in a background process and test them 🧑🏻‍🔬

> startService(filePath: string, options?: StartServiceOptions);
>
> _Since **1.9.0**_

`startService` execute a file directly and keep it running in a background process until you release it.

<div className='features black'>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>Allows **cookies** to persist (_or not_) 🍪</span>
  </div>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      **Poku** allows you to use the requester you want, such as **Axios**, the
      native `fetch` and everyone ✨
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      No need to export your app, server or any service, just run it as it is 🚀
    </span>
  </div>
  <div className='p'>
    <Success />
    <span>
      Stop changing your code due to tester rules, you created your code, not
      **Poku** 🩵
    </span>
  </div>

[See practical examples using **fetch**, **Axios**, a **persistent session** and more](/docs/examples/local-server).

## Good Practices 👮🏽

### ✅ Sinalize the "ready" status

When possible, set a console output to indicate that the service is ready. <br />
This will allow you to avoid premature executions and port leaks.

### ✅ Set a timeout

By defining a timeout, you avert indefinite processes that conclude neither in success nor failure.

### ✅ End your service when the job is done

You don't necessarily have to end your service running in the background as the last line of the test, if it's no longer used.

```ts
import { startService } from 'poku';

const server = await startService('server.js', {
  /**
   * Wait for the "ready" console output
   */
  startAfter: 'ready',

  /**
   * By default, the `timeout` is `60000` (1 minute) for neither success nor failure
   */
  timeout: 60000,
});

await server.end();
```

:::tip

You can pass a port to `end` to enforce the background subprocess end for **Bun** and **Deno**.

ℹ️ To use a port in `end`, you will need `lsof` for **Unix** or `netstat` for **Windows**.

:::

:::info
If you're encountering issues using this feature with **Bun**, please see [**oven-sh/bun#11055**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/11055) when using `end` method passing a port or [**oven-sh/bun#7441**](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/7441) for unfinished subprocesses.

<FAQ title='Oh No! I broke it, and now? 🤡'>

Releasing a leaking port:

```bash
lsof -i :PORT
```

- Replace `PORT` with the port number you're investigating.

Then, use the `PID` returned with the `kill` command:

```bash
kill -9 PID
```

- Replace `PID` with the actual process ID you found using the `lsof` command.

## Available Options

```ts
type StartServiceOptions = {
  /**
   * - By default, it will resolve in the first console output
   * - By setting a string: it will wait for a specifc string on console output to resolve
   * - By setting a number: it will wait for time in milliseconds to resolve
   *
   * ---
   *
   * ℹ️ `startAfter` is case sensitive.
   *
   * ---
   *
   * @default undefined
   */
  startAfter?: string | number;
  /**
   * Stops the service for neither success nor failure after:
   * @default 60000
   */
  timeout?: number;
  /**
   * Shows the output from service
   */
  verbose?: boolean;
  /**
   * Specify a target path to start the process

  cwd?: string | undefined;
  /**
   * By default, Poku will try to identify the actual platform, but you can specify it manually
   */
  platform?: 'node' | 'bun' | 'deno';
};

type End = (port?: number | number[]) => Promise<void>;
