# Is Poku Safe?

**Poku** is an open-source project, so you can see both the [Source Code on **GitHub** Repository](https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku) and the [Distribution Code on **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poku?activeTab=code).

## Why does Poku use `child_process`?

Some test runners use **`eval`**, **Poku** prefers to use **`spawn`** to create a isolated process securely for each test file.

## Protective Measures

- Blocks access above target directory by filtering `../` and `/` paths, for example:
  - `/root` will be sanitized to `./root`
  - `../../etc/secret` will be sanitized to `./etc/secret`
- Normalizes paths according to the OS, allowing all collaborators to use the same path, each using their own OS:
  - `\` for **Windows**
  - `/` for **Linux** and **macOS**
- Normalizes paths by filtering unusual path characters, for example:
  - `<>|^?*`
- Prevents shell scripts by setting `shell` to `false` in **`spawn`** options, ensuring that only secure arguments will be used.
- Every **RegExp** is prev-tested using the [**ReDoS Checker**](https://devina.io/redos-checker).
