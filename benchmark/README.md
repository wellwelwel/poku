The testers to be compared are chosen based on the three most downloaded test runners according to the **npm** weekly statistics _(2024/06/09)_:

- [**Jest**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest): 23,549,369
- [**Mocha**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha): 8,053,244
- [**Vitest**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest): 4,840,171

**Poku** is continuously tested ([**CI**](https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci_benchmark.yml)) to ensure the following expectations for basic usage:

## 🏃🏻‍♀️ Execution Tests

> [!NOTE]
>
> Focuses solely in execution, using a simple `assert(true)` or `assert(false)` from **Node.js** and searches for files in four levels of depth.
>
> - **success:** a suite of 5 tests that will pass.
> - **failure:** a suite of 5 tests that will fail.
> - **balanced:** a suite of 10 tests where 5 tests will fail and 5 tests will pass.

- ~**4x** faster than [**Jest**](https://github.com/jestjs/jest) (v29.7.0)
- ~**4x** faster than [**Vitest**](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) (v3.0.6)
- ~**1x** faster than [**Mocha**](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) (v11.1.0) — _even with test file isolation_
