# Security Policy

## Is Poku Safe?

**Poku** is an open-source project, so you can see both the [Source Code on **GitHub** Repository](https://github.com/wellwelwel/poku) and the [Distribution Code on **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/poku?activeTab=code).

### Why does Poku use `child_process`?

Some test runners use **`eval`**, **Poku** prefers to use **`spawn`** to create a isolated process securely for each test file.
